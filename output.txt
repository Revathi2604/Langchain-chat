page_content='"Christmas won\'t be Christmas without any presents," grumbled Jo, lying on the rug."It\'s so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at her old dress."I don\'t think it\'s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy, with an injured sniff."We\'ve got Father and Mother, and each other," said Beth contentedly from her corner.The four young faces on which the ﬁrelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, "We haven\'t got Father, and shall not have him for a long time." She didn\'t say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where the ﬁghting was.Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, "You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can\'t do much, but we can make our little sacriﬁces, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don\'t," and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted."But I don\'t think the little we should spend would do any good. We\'ve each got a dollar, and the army wouldn\'t be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I\'ve wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm."I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle–holder.Little Women: Chapter 1 by Louisa May Alcott\n2Created for Lit2Go on the web at etc.usf.edu' metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/little-women.pdf', 'page': 1}
page_content='"I shall get a nice box of Faber\'s drawing pencils; I really need them," said Amy decidedly."Mother didn\'t say anything about our money, and she won\'t wish us to give up everything. Let\'s each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I\'m sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner."I know I do––teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I\'m longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the complaining tone again."You don\'t have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo. "How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisﬁed, and worries you till you\'re ready to ﬂy out the window or cry?""It\'s naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can\'t practice well at all." And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time."I don\'t believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy, "for you don\'t have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don\'t know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if he isn\'t rich, and insult you when your nose isn\'t nice.""If you mean libel, I\'d say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa was a pickle bottle," advised Jo, laughing."I know what I mean, and you needn\'t be statirical about it. It\'s proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary," returned Amy, with dignity.Little Women: Chapter 1 by Louisa May Alcott\n3Created for Lit2Go on the web at etc.usf.edu' metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/little-women.pdf', 'page': 2}
page_content='"Don\'t peck at one another, children. Don\'t you wish we had the money Papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy and good we\'d be, if we had no worries!" said Meg, who could remember better times."You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the King children, for they were ﬁghting and fretting all the time, in spite of their money.""So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are. For though we do have to work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.""Jo does use such slang words!" observed Amy, with a reproving look at the long ﬁgure stretched on the rug.Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle."Don\'t, Jo. It\'s so boyish!""That\'s why I do it.""I detest rude, unladylike girls!""I hate affected, niminy–piminy chits!""Birds in their little nests agree," sang Beth, the peacemaker, with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the "pecking" ended for that time."Really, girls, you are both to be blamed," said Meg, beginning to lecture in her elder–sisterly fashion. "You are old enough to leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn\'t matter so much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady."Little Women: Chapter 1 by Louisa May Alcott\n4Created for Lit2Go on the web at etc.usf.edu' metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/little-women.pdf', 'page': 3}
page_content='"I\'m not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I\'ll wear it in two tails till I\'m twenty," cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane. "I hate to think I\'ve got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster! It\'s bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy\'s games and work and manners! I can\'t get over my disappointment in not being a boy. And it\'s worse than ever now, for I\'m dying to go and ﬁght with Papa. And I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!"And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball bounded across the room."Poor Jo! It\'s too bad, but it can\'t be helped. So you must try to be contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us girls," said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch."As for you, Amy," continued Meg, "you are altogether too particular and prim. Your airs are funny now, but you\'ll grow up an affected little goose, if you don\'t take care. I like your nice manners and reﬁned ways of speaking, when you don\'t try to be elegant. But your absurd words are as bad as Jo\'s slang.""If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?" asked Beth, ready to share the lecture."You\'re a dear, and nothing else," answered Meg warmly, and no one contradicted her, for the \'Mouse\' was the pet of the family.As young readers like to know \'how people look\', we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly without, and the ﬁre crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books ﬁlled the recesses, chrysanthemums and Little Women: Chapter 1 by Louisa May Alcott\n5Created for Lit2Go on the web at etc.usf.edu' metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/little-women.pdf', 'page': 4}
page_content='Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen–year–old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns ﬁerce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a ﬂyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn\'t like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth–haired, bright–eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her \'Little Miss Tranquility\', and the name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone brightened to welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze."They are quite worn out. Marmee must have a new pair."Little Women: Chapter 1 by Louisa May Alcott\n6Created for Lit2Go on the web at etc.usf.edu' metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/little-women.pdf', 'page': 5}
page_content='"I thought I\'d get her some with my dollar," said Beth."No, I shall!" cried Amy."I\'m the oldest," began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, "I\'m the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for he told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.""I\'ll tell you what we\'ll do," said Beth, "let\'s each get her something for Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.""That\'s like you, dear! What will we get?" exclaimed Jo.Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, "I shall give her a nice pair of gloves.""Army shoes, best to be had," cried Jo."Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed," said Beth."I\'ll get a little bottle of cologne. She likes it, and it won\'t cost much, so I\'ll have some left to buy my pencils," added Amy."How will we give the things?" asked Meg."Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles. Don\'t you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?" answered Jo."I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the presents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles," said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time.Little Women: Chapter 1 by Louisa May Alcott\n7Created for Lit2Go on the web at etc.usf.edu' metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/little-women.pdf', 'page': 6}

There is so much to do about the play for Christmas night," said Jo, marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air."I don\'t mean to act any more after this time. I\'m getting too old for such things," observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about \'dressing–up\' frolics."You won\'t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down, and wear gold–paper jewelry. You are the best actress we\'ve got, and there\'ll be an end of everything if you quit the boards," said Jo. "We ought to rehearse tonight. Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.""I can\'t help it. I never saw anyone faint, and I don\'t choose to make myself all black and blue, tumbling ﬂat as you do. If I can go down easily, I\'ll drop. If I can\'t, I shall fall into a chair and be graceful. I don\'t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol," returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece."Do it this way. Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room, crying frantically, \'Roderigo! Save me! Save me!\'" and away went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stifﬂy before her, and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her "Ow!" was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. "It\'s no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don\'t blame me.

You\'re a regular Shakespeare!" exclaimed Beth, who ﬁrmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things."Not quite," replied Jo modestly. "I do think The Witches Curse, an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I\'d like to try Macbeth, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing part. \'Is that a dagger that I see before me?" muttered Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do."No, it\'s the toasting fork, with Mother\'s shoe on it instead of the bread.

page_content='While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls ﬂew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping, over–turning, and clattering everything she touched. Beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly happy face, "I\'ve got a treat for you after supper."A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her napkin, crying, "A letter! A letter! Three cheers for Father!""Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls," said Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there."Hurry and get done! Don\'t stop to quirk your little ﬁnger and simper over your plate, Amy," cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come, till the others were ready."I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier," said Meg warmly."Don\'t I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan––what\'s its name?

He will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won\'t ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter."They all drew to the ﬁre, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching. Very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news, and only at the end did the writer\'s heart over–ﬂow with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home."Give them all of my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night, and ﬁnd my best comfort in their affection at all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days need not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully, ﬁght their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women." Everybody sniffed when they came to that part. Jo wasn\'t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother\'s shoulder and sobbed out, "I am a selﬁsh girl!

Nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a Celestial City.""What fun it was, especially going by the lions, ﬁghting Apollyon, and passing through the valley where the hob–goblins were," said Jo."I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs," said Meg."I don\'t remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top.

page_content="The narrative opens with Mr Bingley, a wealthy young ge ntleman and a very eligible bachelor, renting a country\nestate near the Bennets called Netherfield. He arrives accompanied by his fashionable sisters and his good friend,Mr Darcy. Attending the local assembly (dance) Bingley is well received in the community, while Darcy beginshis acquaintance with smug condescension and 'proud' distaste for all the country locals. After Darcy's haughtyrejection of her at the dance, Elizabeth resolves to match his coldness and pride, his prejudice against country\npeople, with her own prideful anger—in biting wit and sometimes sarcastic remarks—directed towards him.\n(Elizabeth's disposition leads her into prejudices regarding Darcy and others, such that she is unable to 'sketch'their characters accurately.)\nSoon, Bingley and Jane begin to grow close. Elizabeth's be st friend, Charlotte, advises that Jane should show her\naffection to Bingley more openly, as he may not realise th at she is indeed interested in him. Elizabeth flippantly\ndismisses the opinion—replying that Jane is shy and modest, and that if Bingley can't see how she feels, he is a\nsimpleton—and she doesn't tell Jane of Charlotte's warning. Later Elizabeth begins a friendship with MrWickham, a militia officer who is of long personal acquaintance with Darcy—they grew up together. Wickhamtells her he has been seriously mistreated by the proud man; Elizabeth seizes on this news as further reason todislike Darcy. Ironically, Darcy begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth, unbeknownst to her.\nMr Collins, the male relative who is to inherit Long bourn, makes an appearance and stays with the Bennets.\nRecently ordained a clergyman, he is employed as parish  rector by the wealthy and patronising Lady Catherine\nde Bourgh of Kent. Mr Bennet and Elizabeth are amused  by his self-important and pedantic behaviour. Though\nhis stated reason for visiting is to reconcile with the Be nnets, Collins soon confides to Mrs Bennet that he wishes\nto find a wife from among the Bennet sisters. He first of fers to pursue Jane; however, Mrs Bennet mentions that\nher eldest daughter is soon likely to be engaged, and redirects his attentions to Elizabeth.\nAt a ball given by Bingley at Netherfield, Elizabeth intends to deepen her acquaintance with Mr Wickham, who,\nhowever, fails to appear. She is asked to dance by Mr Darc y; here she raises Wickham's fate with him, causing\ntheir harmonious dance to fall into a 'testy' discussion. The ball proceeds as spectacle: the arriviste Sir William\nLucas shocks Darcy, alluding to Jane and Bingley and 'a  certain desirable event'; Mr. Collins behaves fatuously;\nnow Mrs Bennet talks loudly and indiscreetly of her exp ectation of marriage between Jane and Bingley, and, in\ngeneral, cousin Collins and the Bennet family—save Ja ne and Elizabeth—combine in a public display of poor\nmanners and upbringing that clearly disgusts Darcy and embarrasses Elizabeth\nThe next morning, Mr Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth, who refuses him, much to her mother's distress.\nCollins handily recovers and, within three days, propos es to Elizabeth's close friend, Charlotte Lucas, who\nimmediately accepts. Once marriage arrangements are settled, Charlotte persuades Elizabeth to come for an\nextended visit to her new bridal home.\nThough appearing at the point of proposing marriage to Jane, Mr Bingley abruptly quits Netherfield and returns\nto London, leaving the lady confused and upset. Elizabeth is convinced that Darcy and Bingley's sister haveconspired to separate Jane and Bingley.\nIn the spring, Elizabeth joins Charlotte and her cousin in Kent. The parsonage is adjacent to Rosings Park—the\ngrand manor of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr Darcy's aunt—where Elizabeth and her hosts are frequentlyinvited to socialize. After Mr Darcy and his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam arrive to visit Lady Catherine, Elizabethrenews her project of teasing Darcy—while his admiration for her grows in spite of his intentions otherwise. NowElizabeth learns from Fitzwilliam that Darcy prides himself on having separated Bingley from Jane; and, with the\npoorest of timing, Darcy chooses this moment to admit hi s love for Elizabeth, and he proposes to her. Incensed\nby his high-handed and insulting manner, she abruptly refuses him. When he asks why—so uncivil her reply—\nElizabeth confronts him with his sabotage of Jane and Bingley's budding relationship and with Wickham'saccount of Darcy's mistreatment of him, among other complaints.Pride and Prejudice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice\n2 of 12 12/1/2010 3:16 P M" metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/Pride and Prejudice.pdf', 'page': 1}

He was found out and stopped only a day before the intended elopement.\nRegarding Bingley and Jane, Darcy justifies his interference: he had observed in Jane no reciprocal interest forBingley; thus he aimed to separate them to protect his friend from heartache.\nIn the letter Darcy admits his 'repugnance' for the 'total want of propriety' of her (Elizabeth's) family, especially\nher mother and three younger sisters. After reading the letter, Elizabeth begins to question both her family's\nbehaviour and Wickham's credibility. She also conclude s: Wickham is not as trustworthy as his easy manners\nwould indicate; that he had lied to her previously; and that her early impressions of Darcy's character might not\nhave been accurate. Soon, Elizabeth returns home.\nSome months later, during a 'northern' tour, Elizabeth and her Aunt and\nUncle Gardiner visit Pemberley, Darcy's estate, while he's away. The elderlyhousekeeper has known Darcy since childhood, and presents a flattering andbenevolent impression of his character to Elizabeth and the Gardiners. Asthey tour the grounds Darcy unexpectedly returns home. Thoughshocked—as is Elizabeth—he makes an obvious effort to be gracious andwelcoming, and treats the Gardiners—whom before he would have dismissedas socially inferior—with remarkable politeness. Later he introducesElizabeth to his sister, a high compliment to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is surprisedand hopeful of a possible new beginning with Darcy.\nElizabeth and Darcy's renewed acquaintance is cut short by news that Lydia,\nthe youngest sister, has run away with Wickham. Initially, the family(wishfully) believe they have eloped, but they soon learn that Wickham hasno plans to marry Lydia. Lydia's antics threaten her family—especially theremaining Bennet sisters—with social ruin. Elizabeth and her aunt and unclehurriedly leave for home; Elizabeth is anguished, and convinced that Darcywill avoid her from now on.\nSoon, thanks apparently to Elizabeth's uncle, Lydia and Wickham are found\nand married. Afterwards, they visit Longbourn; while bragging to Elizabeth,\nLydia discloses that Darcy was present at the wedding. Surprised, Elizabeth\nsends an inquiry to her aunt, from whom she learns that Darcy himself wasresponsible for both finding the couple and arranging  their marriage, at great\nexpense to himself.\nBingley returns to Longbourn and proposes marriage to Jane who\nimmediately accepts. Now Lady Catherine surprisingly visits Long bourn. She\nsternly tells Elizabeth she has heard rumours of Darcy proposing to her; shecame with 'determined resolution' to confront Elizabeth and to demand thatshe never accept such a pr oposal. Elizabeth refuses to bow to Lady Catherine's demands. Furious, 'Lady C'\ncharges off and tells Darcy of Elizabeth's obstinacy—wh ich convinces him that Elizabeth's opinion of him has\nchanged. He now visits Longbourn, and once again proposes marriage. Elizabeth accepts, and the two become\nengaged.\nThe novel's final chapters establish the futures of the ch aracters: Elizabeth and Darcy settle at Pemberley, where\nMr Bennet visits often; Mrs Bennet remains frivolous and silly—she often visits the new Mrs Bingley and talks o\nfPride and Prejudice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice\n3 of 12 12/1/2010 3:16 P M" metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/Pride and Prejudice.pdf', 'page': 2}

At Pemberley, Elizabeth and\nGeorgiana grow close; Georgiana is surprised by Elizab eth\'s playful treatment of Darcy, and she grows more\ncomfortable with her brother.

Elizabeth and\nDarcy remain close to her Uncle and Aunt Gardiner—the agents of their reconciling and uniting.\nElizabeth Bennet  is the central character and\nprotagonist. The reader sees the unfolding plotand the other characters mostly from her\nviewpoint.[3] The second of the Bennet daughters\nat twenty years old, she is intelligent, lively,\nattractive, and witty, but with a tendency to judge\non first impressions and perhaps to be a little\nselective of the evidence upon which she bases\nher judgments.

This is the other of the\nfirst two illustrations of the\nnovel.and is susceptible to attacks of tremors and\npalpitations. Her public manners and social\nclimbing are embarrassing to Jane and Elizabeth.\nHer favourite daughter is the youngest, Lydia.\nJane Bennet  is the eldest Bennet sister. T wenty-two years old when\nthe novel begins, she is considered the most beautiful young lady in\nthe neighbourhood. Her character is contrasted with Elizabeth\'s as\nsweeter, shyer, and equally sensible, but not as clever; her most\nnotable trait is a desire to see only the good in others. Jane is closest to\nElizabeth, and her character is often contrasted with that of Elizabeth.\nMary Bennet  is the only plain Bennet sister, and rather than join in\nsome of the family activities, she reads, although is often impatient for\ndisplay. She works hard for knowledge and accomplishment, but has\nneither genius nor taste. At the ball at Netherfield, she embarrasses her\nfamily by singing badly.\nCatherine "Kitty" Bennet  is the fourth Bennet sister, aged\nseventeen. She is portrayed as a less headstrong but equally silly\nshadow of Lydia.\nLydia Bennet  is the youngest Bennet sister, aged fifteen when the\nnovel begins. She is repeatedly described as frivolous and headstrong.\nHer main activity in life is socialising, especially flirting with the\nmilitary officers stationed in the nearby town of Meryton. She\ndominates her older sister Kitty and is supported in the family by her\nmother. After she elopes with Wickham and he is paid to marry her,\nshe shows no remorse for the embarrassment that her actions caused\nfor her family, but acts as if she has made a wonderful match of which\nher sisters should be jealous.\nCharles Bingley  is a young gentleman without an estate. His wealth\nwas recent, and he is seeking a permanent home. He re nts the Netherfield estate near Longbourn when the\nnovel opens. Twenty-two years old at the start of the novel, charismatic, handsome, good-natured, and\nwealthy, he is contrasted with his friend Darcy as be ing less intelligent but kinder and more charming and\nhence more popular in Meryton. He lacks resolve and is easily influenced by others.\nCaroline Bingley  is the snobbish sister of Charles Bingley. Clearly harbouring romantic intentions on\nDarcy herself, she views his growing attachment to Elizabeth Bennet with some jealousy, resulting in\ndisdain and frequent verbal attempts to undermine Elizabeth and her society.\nGeorge Wickham  is an old acquaintance of Darcy from chil dhood, and an officer in the militia unit\nstationed near Meryton. Superficially charming, he rapidly forms a friendship with Elizabeth Bennet,\nprompting remarks upon his suitability as a potential husband. He spreads numerous tales about the wrongs\nDarcy has done to him, colouring the popular perception of the other man in local society. It is eventually\nrevealed that these tales are distortions, and that Darcy was the wronged man in their acquaintance.\nWilliam Collins , aged twenty-five, is Mr Bennet\'s clergyman co usin and, as Mr Bennet has no son, heir to\nhis estate. Austen described him as "not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little\nassisted by education or society."

Elizabeth is later somewhat distressed — although\nunderstanding — when her closest friend, Charlotte Lucas , consents to marry Collins out of her need for a\nsettled position and to avoid the low status and lack of autonomy of an old maid.\nLady Catherine de Bourgh , who has wealth and social standing, is haughty, domineering and\ncondescending. Mr Collins, among others, enables these characteristics by deferring to her opinions and\ndesires. Elizabeth, however, is duly respectful but not intimidated. Darcy, whilst respectful of their shared\nfamily connection, is offended by her lack of manners, especially towards Elizabeth, and later — when\npressed by her demand that he not marry Elizabeth — is quick to assert his intentions to marry whom he\nwishes.\nAunt and Uncle Gardiner : he is Mrs Bennet's brother, and a successful businessman in London—quite\nsensible and gentleman-like. His wife is close with—a mentor to—both Elizabeth and Jane, and she proves\nvital in assisting Elizabeth and in interpreting Darcy.

page_content='A comprehensive web showing the relationships between the main characters in Pride and Prejudice\nMany critics take the novel\'s title as a starting point when analysing the major themes of Pride and Prejudice ;\nhowever, Robert Fox cautions against reading too much in to the title since commercial factors may have played\na role in its selection. "After the success of Sense and Sensibility , nothing would have seemed more natural than\nto bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title. It\nshould be pointed out that the qualities of the title ar e not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the\nprotagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice."[4]\nA major theme in much of Austen\'s work is the importa nce of environment and upbringing on the development o f\nyoung people\'s character and morality.[5] Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world,\nand a further theme common to Jane Austen\'s work is ineffectual parents. In Pride and Prejudice , the failure of\nMr and Mrs Bennet (particularly the latter) as parents is  blamed for Lydia\'s lack of moral judgment; Darcy, on\nthe other hand, has been taught to be principled  and scrupulously honourable, but is also proud and\noverbearing.[5] Kitty, rescued from Lydia\'s bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they\nmarry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.[6]\nPride and Prejudice , like most of Jane Austen\'s works, employs the narrative technique of free indirect speech.Pride and Prejudice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice\n7 of 12 12/1/2010 3:16 P M' metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/Pride and Prejudice.pdf', 'page': 6}
page_content='Modern paperback editions of Pride\nand PrejudiceThis has been defined as "the free representation of a character\'s speech, by which one means, not words\nactually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character\'s thoughts, or the way the character would\nthink or speak, if she thought or spoke".[3] By using narrative which adopts the tone and vocabulary of a\nparticular character (in this case, that of Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth\'s\nviewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. "The learning curve, while undergone by both\nprotagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth\'s point of view and her f ree indirect speech is essential ...\nfor it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth\'s misprisions."[3]\nAusten began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in\nKent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796.[7] The novel was\noriginally titled First Impressions  by Jane Austen, and was written\nbetween October 1796 and August 1797.[8] On 1 November 1797\nAusten\'s father gave the draft to London bookseller Thomas Cadell in\nhopes of it being published, but it was rejected.[9] The unpublished\nmanuscript was returned to Austen and it stayed with her.\nAusten made significant revisions to the manuscript for First\nImpression s between 1811 and 1812.[8] She later renamed the story\nPride and Prejudice . In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in\nmind the "sufferings and oppositions" summarized in the final chapterof Fanny Burney\'s Cecilia , called "Pride and Prejudice", where the\nphrase appears three times in block capitals.[5] It is possible that the\nnovel\'s original title was altered to avoid confusion wi th other works. In the years between the completion of\nFirst Impression s and its revision into Pride and Prejudice , two other works had been published under that\nname: a novel by Margaret Holford and a comedy by Horace Smith.[9]\nAusten sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egert on of Whitehall in exchange for £110 (Austen had asked\nfor £150).[10] This proved a costly decision. Austen had published Sense and Sensib ility on a commission basis,\nwhereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher\'s\ncommission. Unaware that Sense and Sensibility  would sell out its edition, making her £140,[9] she passed the\ncopyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that al l the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus\nhas calculated that Egerton subsequently made around £450 from just the first two editions of the book.[11]\nEgerton published the first edition of Pride and Prejudice  in three hardcover volumes in January 1813, priced at\n18s.[8] Favourable reviews saw this edition sold out, with a second edition published in November that year. A\nthird edition was published in 1817.[10]\nForeign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French; subsequent translations were published in\nGerman, Danish and Swedish.[12] Pride and Prejudice  was first published in the United States in August 1832 as\nElizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice .[10] The novel was also included in Richard Bentley\'s Standard Novel\nseries in 1833. R. W. Chapman\'s scholarly edition of Pride and Prejudice , first published in 1923, has become\nthe standard edition from which many modern publications of the novel are based.[10]Pride and Prejudice - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice\n8 of 12 12/1/2010 3:16 P M' metadata={'source': 'D:/Intern Prjt/langchain-chat/data/Pride and Prejudice.pdf', 'page': 7}

Charlotte Brontë wrote to noted critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes after\nreading a review of his published in Fraser\'s Magazine  in 1847. He had praised Jane Austen\'s work and declared\nthat he, "... would rather have written Pride and Prej udice, or Tom Jones, than any of the Waverley Novels".[13]\nMiss Brontë, though, found Pride and Prejudice  a disappointment, "... a carefully fenced, highly cultivated\ngarden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but ... no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny\nbeck."[13]\nModern popularity\nIn 2003 the BBC conducted the largest ever po ll for the "UK\'s Best-Loved Book" in which Pride and\nPrejudice  came second, behind The Lord of the Rings .[14]\nIn a 2008 survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers, Pride and Prejudice  came first in a list of the\n101 best books ever written.[15]\nFilm, television, and theatre\nSee also: Jane Austen in popular culture – Pride and Prejudice\nPride and Prejudice  has engendered numerous adaptations. Some of the notable film versions include that of\n1940 starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier,[16] and that of 2005 starring Keira Knightley (in an Oscar-\nnominated performance) and Matthew Macfadyen.[17] Notable television versions include two by the BBC: the\npopular 1995 version starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Fi rth, and a 1980 version starring Elizabeth Garvie and\nDavid Rintoul. A 1936 stage version was created by Helen Jerome played at the St. James\'s Theatre in London,\nstarring Celia Johnson and Hugh Williams. First Impressions  was a 1959 Broadway musical version starring\nPolly Bergen, Farley Granger, and Hermione Gingold.[18] In 1995, a musical concept album was written by\nBernard J. Taylor, with Peter Karrie in the role of Mr Darcy and Claire Moore in the role of Elizabeth Bennet.[19]\nA new stage production, Jane Austen\'s Pride and Prejudice, The New Musical , was presented in concert on 21\nOctober 2008 in Rochester, New York with Colin Donnell as Darcy.[20]\nBride and Prejudice , starring Aishwarya Rai, is a Bollywood adaptation of the novel; while Pride & Prejudice:\nA Latter-Day Comedy  (2003), starring Kam Heskin and Orlando Seale, pl aces the novel at a Mormon university\nin modern times.[21][22] Bridget Jones\'s Diary  is a loose adaptation of the novel in a modern setting, starring\nRenee Zellweger as a modern-day Elizabeth, and Colin Firth once again as Mr Darcy. The off-Broadway musical\nI Love You Because  reverses the gender of the main roles, set in modern day New York City. The Japanese comic\nHana Yori Dango  by Yoko Kamio, in which the wealthy, arroga nt and proud protagonist, Doumyouji Tsukasa,\nfalls in love with a poor, lower-class girl named Makino Tsukushi, is loosely based on Pride and Prejudice .
